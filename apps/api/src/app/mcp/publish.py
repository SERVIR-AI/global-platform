"""One call to finish: gate the draft, mint the receipt, hand back how to show it.

This exists because of a measured failure, not a design preference. With the loop
split across `verify_groundedness` then `record_receipt`, no model tested completed
it from a plain question — not Sonnet at medium effort in Claude Desktop, not
gpt-4o, not gpt-4o-mini. Every one assembled the pack, wrote a good brief, and
emitted it as prose. Two of them even ANNOUNCED that they would verify next, then
did not: once a model holds a satisfying answer, further tool calls read as
optional ceremony, and no wording in a tool result changed that.

So the remaining work is collapsed into a single obvious finish. The composite is
not a shortcut around the contract — it IS the contract: the draft is gated first
and a receipt is minted only if it passes, so there is no path through this tool
that publishes something ungated. `verify_groundedness` and `record_receipt` stay
exactly as they were for callers that want the steps separately.
